# Hold Fire.

uint16 duration_ms # [millisecond]
# Specifies the minimum duration of the hold period, measured in milliseconds.
# The 'duration_ms' parameter ensures a minimum time gap between the active levels of the trigger,
# effectively cancelling any ongoing firing action and preventing immediate reactivation. It is not a strict delay,
# but rather a guarantee of a minimal gap to ensure safe and controlled firing sequences.
